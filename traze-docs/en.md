## Introduction

Traze is an opensource, free to use application, designed to run in the browser environment. This documentation will guide you through its features and capabilities. Traze provides essential trading features including token swapping and transaction monitoring.

## Getting Started

Welcome to Traze! Let's get you started with our friendly trading interface. The dashboard has two main parts:

1. A flexible workspace where you can arrange everything just the way you like it
2. A helpful header with all the tools you need

Here's what you'll find in the header: ![Header components](images/header_cap.png)

On the left, you'll see our Component list - think of it as your trading toolbox. Just grab what you need and drop it into your workspace. We're always adding new tools based on what our community needs! ![Component list](images/component_list_cap.png)

On the right side, you'll find everything else you might need: ![Navigation items](images/navigation_cap.png)

We start you off with Solana's main network, but for the best experience, you might want to use your own RPC endpoint. You can get one from providers like Quicknode, Helius, or erpc - even their free accounts let you make 5 trades per second. That means you can run 5 trading bots at once!

## Features

### Swarm

Swarm is your trading team manager! It lets you organize your wallets into strategic groups and set up custom trading rules for each one. Whether you're running multiple strategies or managing different portfolios, you can create as many swarms as you need in your workspace. Each swarm can have its own unique purpose and trading approach.
